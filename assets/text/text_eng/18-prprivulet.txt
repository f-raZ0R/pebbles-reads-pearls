This appears to be a dissertation written by my neighbor, Looks to the Moon.<LINE>The topic is on Sliver of Straw, more specifically her death.

I can’t imagine that a creature like you would know of her, but she is a topic of immense study and debate among us.

No one knows how, but through some way or another, she managed to broadcast a triple affirmative, that she had managed to find a solution to the Great Problem.<LINE>However, she died shortly after sending it.

I have my own theories of how she accomplished it, we all did.<LINE>Although it appears that Moon believes “She should be allowed to rest in peace now.”

I suppose she was right.
