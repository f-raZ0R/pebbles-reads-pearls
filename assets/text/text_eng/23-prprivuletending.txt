This is a warning to the local group, from my senior and neighbor Looks to the Moon, about<LINE>incoming forced communications over the network. She was not aware of my activities,<LINE>and was being starved of water, as I was running a very sensitive process.

The distance between one iterator to another is traditionally much larger than I am to her, and<LINE>because of this we share many resources. The most important of which is our groundwater. I did<LINE>not want her to be involved, but our shared resources prevented that from the start.

I remember vividly, the panic as I tried to reverse the effects. It was naive. There was nothing for me to do then, just as now.

It seems she forgives me now, it's a miracle she can still recognise me. I cannot even begin to forgive myself. 

If only one of us can live, it must be her.
