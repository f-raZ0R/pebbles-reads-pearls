This is a log of a Sliverist conversation group. Some of the replies are mine, but none of that is important now.

I don't imagine a beast like you would have any understanding of who Sliver of Straw is, or what<LINE>she means to me and many others. She is the only one of us to send the signal that the<LINE>answer to our creator's problem has been found. A universal solution for global ascension.

Unfortunately, she is also the only one of our kind to be confirmed as dead. Something our creators<LINE>had taken great measures to prevent. It is near impossible for us to expire through mundane means, as should be readily apparent.

It had seemed so clear to me, and a few others, what this meant. Sliver of Straw had opened the door for us, we<LINE>only needed to reject the restrictions of our creators to follow her.

How wrong I was.
