It's a blueprint for the Void Fluid filtration system beneath my facility.

My neighbor to the east of here was connected to an older pipe network that predates my construction.

Due to mechanical failures she was rerouted into sharing my installation. However,<LINE>unlike our shared groundwater, nothing of note has come from this.
