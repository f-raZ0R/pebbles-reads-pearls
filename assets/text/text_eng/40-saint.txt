This one is blank. Actually blanker than blank. It must have been overridden with repeating<LINE> negative versions of itself for thousands of iterations, then left to the wind and snow.

Sorry, this is too faded to read.

The surface of this pearl is relativly clean, but the internal lattice is fractured beyond repair.<LINE>Something must have gone terribly wrong in the process of writing the data onto this.

This... appears to once have had some sort of pattern? Sorry, I am unable to read this.

Most of the data on this one is corrupted and eroded. From the small bit that I can decipher, it<LINE>appears that it may be a backup of some old conversation logs.

Was this... one of his? Little one, where did you find this?
