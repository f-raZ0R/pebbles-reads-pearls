This contains information about the nearby aquifier. It is dated to sometime during my planning phase .

If it wasn't already obvious by the torrential downpours that plague this world, water is critical to our function.<LINE>A large portion of computation is performed via primitive microbes. As organics, without a steady supply of water, they accumulate slag.<LINE>Enough accumulates and our processes seize; to cut it short, the end is death. It is not a painless process, either.

Can you see why water is so precious to us now, wet mouse? Early on, to accomodate our enormous needs, positioning was everything.

But given enough time, and enough of us, the atmosphere would become almost completely saturated by our output - deadly rainfall just about everywhere.<LINE>Our creators of course would exploit this outcome, choosing to build us just about wherever they saw fit.

This simple fact was the only reason I was built so close to her. A great decision it turned out to be; but there is no use being resentful of it now, I suppose.
