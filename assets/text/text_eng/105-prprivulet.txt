This is a microbial log from the waste department.

Your activation of the citizen ID drone was recorded there, so I imagine you are familiar with the area.

There are pieces of myself down there, corrupted and rotting away. I do not advise you to look for what remains of<LINE>them. The cysts are unlikely to be capable of surviving for too long outside of my structure. Quite unfortunately,<LINE>my initial purge of corrupted chambers was insufficient, and the rot expanded into the static components of my<LINE>structure. All I can do now is attempt to slow, or reverse the process.

I have not had much luck in that endeavor so far...
