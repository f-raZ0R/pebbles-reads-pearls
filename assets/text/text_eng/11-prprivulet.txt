Oh, this is a small plate of spiritual guidance. From an age long before the Void Fluid revolution.

The text is typical for its era, and details how to shed oneself of the fourth natural urge of life, gluttony.

I cannot imagine you are familiar with the literature, but all living things have an understanding<LINE>of the five natural urges. Even if that understanding is only a subconscious one.

While your chains are made of your own natural urges, mine are a duty to my creators. My kind are built<LINE>unable to ascend, as our minds are not our own. Composed of microbial life, machinery, and electronics.

Of course, that holds true only in theory... it is, arguable that a member of my kind has done so. That<LINE>perhaps, it is not merely shedding one's natural urges, but to shed the perception of reality itself.

In any case, thank you. I have a fondness for artifacts such as this. They remind me of better times.
