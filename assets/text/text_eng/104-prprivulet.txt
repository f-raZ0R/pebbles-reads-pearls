Did you find this beyond the retaining wall? I can't imagine another place you might. How you got there, I will not question.

These are the final operating logs of a transit control tower. They regulated the inbound and<LINE>outbound traffic of shipments to and from of our facility. This log shows the point at which<LINE>the caravans suspended their final shipments, and became frozen in time as they remain now.

While some of the machinery out there has ceased function due to age and decay, others were purposely<LINE>ordered to stop during the final moments before our creators' global ascension reached its conclusion.

I'm sure you've seen the world my creators left behind, then? The surface beyond the facility<LINE>walls is a sea of mud, ruins, and thick plant life. The ground out there is almost like water, and<LINE>few things remain stable. Ancient structures uncovered by fissures, only to be buried again.

The land around the retaining wall eroded long ago, and the subway system that connects me<LINE>to my distant peers was eventually made into a network of railway bridges. They were used<LINE>to ship construction material, until the surface became too dangerous.

The ground beneath us is like an artificial mountain, with a layer of clouds that covers it.

The few that rejected living above those clouds could only choose to venture as far into<LINE>the expanse as they could. There were rumors that you could see the sky if the fog became<LINE>thin enough. I wonder if those rumors were true, or just optimistic stories?
