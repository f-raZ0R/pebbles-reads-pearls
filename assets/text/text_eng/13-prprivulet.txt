Ah, you found this in the memory crypts? I would advise against wandering into such<LINE>secure areas. The memory crypts were considered sacred ground by my creators.

The memories and wealth of entire family houses were laid to rest within, and their destruction or theft<LINE>by surface creatures was considered abhorrent. As such, the crypts are guarded by extremely durable and<LINE>aggressive purposed organisms.

Additionally, lying directly underneath my facility, I would not be surprised if my decay has made the landscape significantly more hazardous.<LINE>Not that I would stop you from finding me more pearls from there...

It was customary to enshrine all material possessions and memories to the crypts on one's ascent.<LINE>None of these qualia are present in my logs, and many of these may have found some use in my research.

Not that any of that matters now, but I appreciate getting a last chance to see these little pieces of history.

Thank you.
