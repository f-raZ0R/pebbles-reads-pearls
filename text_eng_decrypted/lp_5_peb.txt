[LIVE BROADCAST] - PRIVATE Seven Red Suns, No Significant Harassment

SRS: I just don't understand... why hasn't Moon done anything about the situation herself?

SRS: She was appointed as Pebbles' superior. She has the power to stop him.

NSH: I've been very close with Moon, and I can tell you she is incredibly caring.

NSH: And while her kindness is one of her greatest attributes, it is also to her detriment.

SRS: Isn't this excessive, though? Surely she at least has a sense of self-preservation.

NSH: I'm sure she convinced herself that she could help Pebbles. That she could bring him under control with words rather than forced action.

NSH: She's probably still trying that now, unless her systems have degraded past the point of even allowing that.

NSH: That's why this is so tragic to me.
