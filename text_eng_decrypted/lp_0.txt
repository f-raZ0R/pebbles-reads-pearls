[LIVE BROADCAST] - PRIVATE Seven Red Suns, No Significant Harassment

SRS: I can't stop dwelling over mistakes that I've made. I could just delete those memories of course, but that feels irresponsible.

NSH: Oh? What kind of mistakes are we talking about here?

SRS: I once gave someone some... sensitive information... the kind that could be dangerous if acted on.

SRS: Yet I should have known they weren't in the right state to use that information responsibly.

NSH: I take it you won't tell me the content, or to who.

SRS: No, I will not, out of respect.

NSH: Look, if you ever want to talk about it I can. We can share this little problem of yours. We were made to solve them after all!

NSH: You're worried they're going to get themselves hurt by messing it up?

SRS: They already have.
