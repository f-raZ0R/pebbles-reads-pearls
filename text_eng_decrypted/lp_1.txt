[LIVE BROADCAST] - PRIVATE Seven Red Suns, No Significant Harassment

NSH: It's pretty clear to me who you're talking about. Though I won't say who, out of respect ~

SRS: Please don't mock me, this is serious.

SRS: The fact is, he really looked up to me. As much as I gave him a hard time, that's not something I took lightly.

NSH: You're not the only one worried about him. I understand your position, but blaming yourself isn't productive.

SRS: I understand that. I truly do. At this point we need to be taking action.

NSH: I agree, but unfortunately there's not much that we can do being locked up in a box.

NSH: Even less so that he's cut off all communication and is rejecting all help from the outside world.

SRS: That may not be an issue, necessarily. I've already set a certain plan in motion...
