Will: Originally, Moon's structure was going to include her Communications Array, and a bit of a Sky Islands like area.

Will: However, this was already a bit too much at the time. By the time we added the underwater caves and city there was no room.

Will: It's crazy how many ideas we had planned for Moon, but never had the chance to include all of them.

Will: I wonder if separating Moon's city into its own giant region with unique connections<LINE>would have fixed it? Maybe something for the future if we ever expand the mod ourselves?

Will: Ignore the plant, I just wanted to see how big these could actually get! It looks pretty funny.
