[LIVE BROADCAST] - PRIVATE Seven Red Suns, No Significant Harassment

SRS: Do you know how I sent the sensitive information last time? It certainly wasn't over the broadcast network.

SRS: I purposed a messenger, and sent the information by land via a data pearl.

NSH: How original of you.

SRS: I learned from the best. At least I used it for something more... practical.

NSH: If you call that practical, sure. Look how well things turned out ~

SRS: ...

SRS: Regardless, the fact is the method worked fine last time. The info was delivered, and the messenger even returned safely.

SRS: So, I've recently sent it out again to deliver another message, despite the closed communication lines.

NSH: With how this situation has evolved, that's going to be quite the dangerous trip compared to before.

SRS: Again, that may not be an issue. I've outfitted my messenger with all it needs to protect itself.
