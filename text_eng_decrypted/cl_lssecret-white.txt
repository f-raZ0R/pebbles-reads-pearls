Will: After all that Five Pebbles' structure has been through. Showing its collapsed state as something both dark and hopeful was important.

Will: I wanted to turn the inside into a sort of miniature Undergrowth. Where the remaining body heat of the facility provided safety.

Will: At least the creatures of the world beneath have a new home in the cold.
