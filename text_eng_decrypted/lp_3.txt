[LIVE BROADCAST] - PRIVATE Seven Red Suns, No Significant Harassment

NSH: I am worried right now, to be honest.

SRS: Why is that?

NSH: It's about Looks To The Moon. She's very close to Five Pebbles, and she's a very dear friend of mine.

SRS: Oh, right... no one has been able to contact her since...

NSH: Exactly. She wouldn't willingly tune us out. I worry that her systems are incredibly damaged.

SRS: There isn't much we can do, is there?

NSH: We just have to try to help her the best we can. For now I'm going to hold out hope that she'll eventually respond.

SRS: What if she doesn't?

NSH: I may send a little care package if things get desperate enough.
