I honestly can't tell what this is. It's light but strong... appears to be some composite material interwoven with bone.<LINE>It seems to have been deliberately altered from its original form, with noticeable fragments that are melded together.

Perhaps an archaeological relic of some civilization's work? I wish I knew more, because this is likely a valuable find!
