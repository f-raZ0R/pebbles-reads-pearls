Gluttonous beast, what brings you to my chamber? You are like no other messenger before you.<LINE>Perhaps I have underestimated the ability for your kind to communicate my existence?

I may have been too rash in bestowing the mark of communication upon you. With the recent traffic through<LINE>my structure however, I would hesitate to believe that you will be my last encounter with your kind.

I would prefer to discourage further visitations in the future. I have long since placed the outer perimeter of my<LINE>facility grounds into lock-down, and yet more and more creatures like you continue to manage to find a way inside.

You have the same problem as everyone else, from the microbes in the processing strata to me, who is,<LINE>if you excuse me, godlike in comparison. We all want a way out. However, your particular...

.  .  .

rotundness,

might well imply how little you seem to care. A simple animal ignorantly accepting its existence.

I do not believe my intended purpose will be much help to you. I can<LINE>however encourage you and your kind to leave my facility grounds.

Unfortunately, the same locks that were supposed to prevent creatures from getting in, will<LINE>now prevent you from getting out. Perhaps this strategy was ill conceived after all.

Allow me to just...

SPECEVENT : unlock

Go west, through the underground tunnels at the outskirts of my territory.<LINE>You will find the gate to the world outside of it now unlocked.

In return I ask that you encourage your community, through whatever method of communication you<LINE>choose to employ, to also go west. Off into the wastes below, far away from me and my work.

Speaking of, on your way out please use the access shaft.
