Will: This is one of the last rooms that Minkimaro did palette work for. They soon drifted away from the mod team.

Will: It's unfortunate, I always really liked their palette work, they did most of the palettes for Spearmaster and Rivulet.

Will: Life caught up with them and they couldn't invest much time in MSC's extended dev cycle.

Will: This is still some beautiful work though.
