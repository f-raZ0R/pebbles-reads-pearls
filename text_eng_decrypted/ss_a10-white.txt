Will: It became more and more clear over development that the rot was<LINE>becoming a sort of plot-crutch. It is a very useful plot device after all!

Will: However, its abuse was pretty apparent. From scavengers fighting it<LINE>in LC, to what we had planned for Rivulet, and even on Spearmaster...

Will: We decided to take the healthiest option, and avoid its abuse entirely. With one<LINE>exception, any reasonable ideas for corruption had to properly fit within Rivulet's Five<LINE>Pebbles. The corruption's ideas were to be contained inside The Rot as a region on its own.

Will: To abuse the corruption beyond that could lead to too many weak plot<LINE>scenarios, where adding corruption would be a cheap and easy answer.

Will: Of course this completely closed the door to ideas like the Judge, or Saint's daddy world ever being used again!

Will: Some idea are better left on the cutting room floor. A single MEGA-ROT themed region was already enough for the mod!
