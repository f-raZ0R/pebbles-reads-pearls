Will: Before I joined the team, Andrew had plans to scrap Spearmaster's campaign entirely.

Will: Most of the reasons were because of Hunter's addition in 1.5, as well as Artificer's gameplay being similar.

Will: What saved Spearmaster was changing perspectives from gameplay to story, and using them as a vehicle to explore the past.

Will: The addition of the endless spear mechanics came later, based on Minkimaro's<LINE>concept art of Spearmaster pulling needles out a hole on their back.

Will: These ideas became the Spearmaster that made it to release, but we actually had two other ideas!

Will: One idea was to give Spearmaster their own separate game mode, with a single large region to explore.

Will: The other was the Judge, a Saint-like slugcat who would have guardian-like powers, and<LINE>throw spears at extremely high speeds. Trapped in a world completely corrupted by the rot.

Will: However, this Daddy World like concept never made it past the "crazy ideas" phase of design.
