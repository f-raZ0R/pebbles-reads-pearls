Will: While the surface of Saint's world feels frozen in a near stasis, the underground regions are in a constant state of change.

Will: Drainage System in particular has been one of the regions to get the most time line care over the course of development.

Will: It might not be everyone's favorite region, but it has certainly put on a show!
