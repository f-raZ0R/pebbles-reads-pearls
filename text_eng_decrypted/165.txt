You, who have encountered a consequence much like my own.

Gripped by raw emotions whose chains bind you, destined to this land

Shortcomings of the past haunt one and all like whispering phantoms

An unrewarding battle awaits, culminating in a path of no return

A perpetuity of struggles begetting more of the same

We are a pair who have forfeited everything.
