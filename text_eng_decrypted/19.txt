I could read a bit of Five Pebbles in this neuron before formatting it. His condition has severely deteriorated since last I<LINE>heard of him. The frustration he feels is profound, and that angst has seeped into every part of him, every neuron.

We were supposed to help everyone, you know. Everything. That was our purpose: a great gift to the lesser beings of the world.<LINE>When facing our inability to do so, we all reacted differently. Many with madness.

Some, out there, might still be trying. Communications have been bad for a long time, and by now<LINE>I suspect most of us are isolated like me, or connected only in small groups.

But even back when we were all more or less connected there were those who reacted to their task with anger.<LINE>I can only imagine they are angrier now, alone in their cans, left only with their insatiable drive.

But to be honest, I don't know how many of us are still alive at this point.
