Oh. Hello there!

What a strange specimen you are! My memory does not serve me well, but it has been a long time<LINE>since I've encountered one of your species. And none quite with adaptations such as your own. It appears you can breathe underwater. Amazing!

More importantly, I wonder who it is that gave you that mark? It could not have been my neighbor Five Pebbles, as<LINE>he has been sick for a very long time. These frequent downpours suggest to me an acute failure in his machinery,<LINE>and in that condition, I doubt any creature could get anywhere near him and still make it back alive.

Then are you from a far away land? Did you meet No Significant Harassment? Or perhaps Chasing Wind? Or even farther than that?

I don't know why you have traveled all this way, but there is nothing for you here. I can only advise you to return to wherever<LINE>you have come from. These lands have become a tremendous hazard, and conditions will only worsen with the passage of time.

I hope you understand, my little friend, I don't mean to be discourteous... I am simply fearing for your safety.
