WO: It was like a tournament?

EOC: It appeared to be something like that, but over territory.

WO: So you and Sliver of Straw took bets on it?

EOC: Well, it wasn't really a bet, more of an intuition of who we each thought would win.

WO: Well, which one did you choose?

EOC: I thought that the green creature was going to win. Sliver thought the red one was.

EOC: But to our surprise, a little cyan intruder won!

WO: Really? How did it manage that?

EOC: The other two had killed most of the competition. Then they were left to fight each other.

EOC: They both severely injured each other, and then the little cyan one came in and finished them off.

WO: Wow, such a little opportunist!

EOC: It was! Sliver and I joked about that little cyan creature often.
