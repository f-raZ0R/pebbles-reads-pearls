Do you see the same as me?

Beauty continuing to bloom even in a place long forgotten.

I did not have the will to depart, nor the desire.

Why did they always search for an escape, as if we were imprisoned?

What offering from the void could usurp the gift of life already given?

This moment, right here! It is where we are meant to be.
