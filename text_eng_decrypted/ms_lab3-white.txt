Andrew: This pearl survived the collapse! This same pearl is in this same room in Spearmaster's LTTM,<LINE>too. Although, Past Moon and Future Moon have different dialog if you deliver the pearl to them.

Andrew: Actually, there's quite a few pearls where this is the case.

Andrew: Depending on timeline location, the dialog wouldn't always make sense, so we<LINE>have some different variations of the pearl readings for different points in time.

Andrew: Did you discover that you can deliver pearls to Pebbles too, during<LINE>Artificer's campaign? He has different things to say for every pearl compared to Moon.

Andrew: I don't expect the player to see all these different possible variations, as pearl<LINE>delivery is far too time consuming and tedious. I imagine it'll be more of a community effort.

Andrew: Though, with all of these timeline differences, I wish good luck to the people<LINE>who eventually try to organize all of this information on the More Slugcats wiki...
