[LIVE BROADCAST] - PRIVATE Seven Red Suns, No Significant Harassment

NSH: How much do you think they understand when we talk to them? The mark gives them linguistical<LINE>cognizance, but it doesn't increase their intelligence. They're still just wild animals, after all.

NSH: I feel like I need to be simplifying my speech patterns. Is that something you do when conversing with your messenger?

SRS: I wouldn't know, I never gave them the mark.

NSH: Really now? Why wouldn't you? Did you just feel the need to add an extra layer of challenge onto this mission?

SRS: No, the problem with the mark is it's a one way communication. They can understand me, but I can't understand them.

SRS: I borrowed a coded language authored in the late period of the Yellow hegemonic dynasty.<LINE>It used gestures and facial expressions as a silent method of communication with the seriously ill.

NSH: Well, that's certainly one way to go about it. You never cease to surprise me.

NSH: Communication with facial expressions though? Did you forget our puppet's face doesn't have articulation? ~

SRS: Yes, well, I had to improvise and use only body gestures, of course.
