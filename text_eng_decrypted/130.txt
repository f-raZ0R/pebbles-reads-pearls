I am grateful - the relief is indescribable!

I could read a bit of Five Pebbles in this neuron before formatting it. I can understand your desire<LINE>to help, but please do not make his situation worse. He has been sick for a very long time. I am<LINE>unsure how much of him is even left now. Being eaten from within by his own experiments.

I've felt anger in these before, but now they seem to be filled with fear and sadness.

We were supposed to help everyone, you know. Everything. That was our purpose: a great gift to the lesser<LINE>beings of the world. When facing our inability to do so, we all reacted differently. Many with madness.

Some, out there, might still be trying. Communications have been bad for a long time, and<LINE>by now I suspect most of us are isolated like me, or connected only in small groups.

But even back when we were all more or less connected, there were those who reacted to their task with anger.<LINE>I can only imagine they are angrier now, alone in their cans, left only with their insatiable drive, like he is.

I don't know how many of us are still alive at this point. By now I cannot imagine many of us desire to be.
