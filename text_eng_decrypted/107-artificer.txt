You are stuck in a cycle of wrath and destruction, simple being.

Gripped by raw emotions whose chains bind you, destined to this land.

Shortcomings of the past haunt one and all like whispering phantoms.

Listen. Let this be a warning to you...

An unrewarding battle awaits, culminating in a path of no return.

A perpetuity of struggles begetting more of the same.

Find a way out, if you still can.
