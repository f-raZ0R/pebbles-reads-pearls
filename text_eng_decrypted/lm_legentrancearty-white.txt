Andrew: Artificer was originally on a point of the timeline after Moon's collapse.

Andrew: This was very shortly after the collapse, however, with her in a broken and unresponsive state.

Andrew: Some of the machinery still hadn't completely failed, and there was still some residual<LINE>zero G... and lots of stray electricity and sparks and chaos from the badly damaged parts.

Andrew: We opted to move Artificer slightly earlier though, so they could be in the less flooded<LINE>pre-collapse Shoreline, which much better suited their incompatibility with water-filled environments.

Andrew: You might be able to still find that unused variant of Moon's collapsed structure in the game, though... somehow.
