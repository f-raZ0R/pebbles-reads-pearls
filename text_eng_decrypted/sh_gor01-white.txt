Will: We had a lot of difficulty early on deciding exactly what Gourmand was going to be about, or if they even had a place in the story.

Will: In a way we did both of those things, by putting Gourmand's existence intentionally in question. They are such a bizarre creature!

Will: However Gourmand's powers seemed too extreme... how could they have such an endless supply of things?

Will: Of course, it's not up to us if you believe Gourmand exists! Watch the ending and choose for yourself what you think.

Will: The community's ideas are always so much more interesting to imagine then us just telling you.

Will: Never take what we say as absolutes! If you have a better theory for things, go wild!
