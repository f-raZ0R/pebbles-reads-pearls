What a fascinating specimen! This is a tightly nested bundle of cellular membranes. However, most of<LINE>the content within and surrounding the various layers is neither air nor water... it's void fluid!

The cells within this capsule are dividing extremely rapidly, countering<LINE>the void fluid's simultaneous dissolving of its container.

Somehow it has managed to reach an equilibrium between creation and destruction, but I suspect<LINE>this is not a very stable system. Any irregular disturbance would likely cause a cascading<LINE>effect on either end of this spectrum, the result of which would be sudden and destructive.

While I would like to hold onto this for further research, I don't think it would be advisable to have something<LINE>so volatile sitting around here. Especially given my chamber's open exposure to the elements.

I would recommend that you be very careful handling this, old friend!
