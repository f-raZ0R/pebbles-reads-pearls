Little saint, I perceive your existence as it passes through my own. I know this is only a dream, but your presence is real.

Do you see it too? Our endless repetitions, circling onward to infinity? From here I can observe the repeating loop of my own<LINE>existence, every iteration a duplicate of the last. I have visions of the entire pattern my creators desired to escape at once.<LINE>An endless sequence of life and death, further beyond my control with each passing cycle.

Where does your cycle go, <PlayerName>? Its edges twist over themselves, like circles within circles, your cycle consumes itself.

What have you become?
