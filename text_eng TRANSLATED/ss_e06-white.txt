Will: Writing for an established character is something incredibly difficult.<LINE>Especially one with little screen time, but with such a big impression.

Will: Straying too far in any direction can instantly create the sensation<LINE>of "fan fiction," where a character suddenly acts only to further a plot.

Will: Avoiding that is hard; one of the ways we tried to do so at first<LINE>was to only follow what was laid out in neuron and pearl conversations.

Will: This fell apart as we reached Artificer as we had the chance to do<LINE>something unique with the character that was not possible to do before.

Will: We had the chance for the player to interact with Five Pebbles at their<LINE>own pace. Instead of being rushed out of his room at the threat of death. As due<LINE>to the drone, he is unable to simply kill them without a justified reason.

Will: Things kind of took on a life of their own. Initially his pearl dialog had more spite, and dislike of the player to them.

Will: However, on specific topics it became interesting to get his insights on certain events, and some of his own pearls.

Will: This created the idea that he might be a little bit of a history buff, or archivist,<LINE>excited to see when the player brings them something not yet documented.

Will: Of course, he still doesn't let down his smug and prideful aura. Even<LINE>around a wild rat he is telling stories to, so it will leave him alone.
