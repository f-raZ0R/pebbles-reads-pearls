Will: Undergrowth was a bit of an experiment! Saint's overworld is a snowy wasteland, but making every region like that was repetitive.

Will: The original concept was made by Tollycastle, creating the idea of a deep underground jungle that was warm enough for life to flourish!

Will: We tried not to make the surface too barren for gameplay reasons, but undergrowth allowed us to flood a region with unique encounters.

Will: As well as bring some more exotic creatures to the front, with OE's jungle leeches, and many of the plants finding a new home here.

Will: There was a thought to use lethal water as a way of adding giant static<LINE>predatory plants as part of the environment, but this concept was never used.

Will: We eventually settled on the depths of Undergrowth containing bio-luminescent mushrooms instead!

Will: The twisting of an old region into a new form is something we experimented on with MS and DM, I think UG came out successful too!
