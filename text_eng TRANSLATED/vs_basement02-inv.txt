Screams: Wanna hear a funny thought?

Screams: Imagine being someone who discovered Paincat before ever seeing pups in the regular game.

Screams: I'm glad the slugpup limit is 2 by default, because the game gets exponentially harder when you add more than that.

Screams: With this in mind, I suggested removing Paincat's pup limit and giving it a<LINE>100% spawn rate in all regions. Will proceeded to add on to this with, and I quote...

Will: "all paincat slugpups spawn as white with red faces"

Will: "and when they die they spawn an activated singularity egg"

Screams: "How do you tell them apart?" I asked.

Will: "You don't."

Andrew: And then I implemented them as level editor gremlins instead...

Dakras: They didn't even have the heart to tell me what they did to my poor, poor slugcat.
