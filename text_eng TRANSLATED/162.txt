Hello <PlayerName>. Are you lost?

I am sorry to say that there is nothing here for you.

0 : You've been given the gift of communication. So I can only imagine that you have<LINE>met Five Pebbles. You must already understand how little of me remains functional. : 5

However, it is nice to have someone to talk to after all this time. My last visitor<LINE>was very sick, so their visits here were not for very long.

I can only hope to remember them for as long as I can in my current state.

Maybe you know them? They left some time ago. My last overseer watched them head to<LINE>the west. Perhaps they were returning home with what little time they had left.

You are welcome to stay as long as you desire <PlayerName>. It is nice to have company.
