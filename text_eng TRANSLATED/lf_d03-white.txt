Will: This room is near where Fiiiiish's Badlands mod connects. It always reminds me that someday we'll have region mods that will<LINE>use all the new features we've added, as well as all the unique world styles each slugcat has. I hope the workload isn't too intense!

Will: Making a region on your own is already a lot of work. Needing to restyle<LINE>your region for both a flood and a snowstorm is pretty silly to do on top of it.

Will: The new conditional link system opens up so many new ways to build a region as well.

Will: There is an exciting future ahead for Rain World modding. I can't wait to see what people will make!
