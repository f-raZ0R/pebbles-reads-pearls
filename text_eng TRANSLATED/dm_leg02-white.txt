Will: When first planning Moon's leg, I planned to mirror the leg of Five Pebbles when placing creatures. However,<LINE>this idea felt a bit hollow and derivative. Looking for ideas I chose to dig into nearby regions and see what stuck.

Will: At first lantern mice felt out of place, until I went afk for an hour, and returned<LINE>to a surprise. The lantern mice had used their threads to hang themselves from the ceiling,<LINE>and completely insulate themselves from the violent electrical events all around them!

Will: The final introduction of mother spiders, and small swarms of tiny spiders would solidify the design of the<LINE>area. Creating a more peaceful leg climb, with small bursts of combat from miros vultures, and orange lizards.
