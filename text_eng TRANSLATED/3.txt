Strange...

Something still draws me here. Even after all this time.

The weather is so different now, but the fields...

I do not need eyes to know that the grasses still sway gently in the winds.

To have grasped at the boundless infinites of the cosmic void...

Yet here I am contemplating these same fields as I once did, talking to some sort of rodent.
