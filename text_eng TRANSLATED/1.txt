Behold this empty husk of a land...

Populated only by storms, ruins and abominations. It wasn't always thus.

I was once the Count of 2 living blocks, esteemed by my peers. I had progeny!

From within my vessel of flesh, I would perch upon this spot to observe the rising of the sun.

Corporeal matters seem so distant now. Most have forgotten this place, but I remain.

Perhaps I reminisce because I cannot go. Perhaps I cannot go because memory traps me here.
