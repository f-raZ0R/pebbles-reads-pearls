Screams: We've come a long way!

Screams: I joined the More Slugcats team in July of 2019, and I've learned<LINE>quite a lot since then. About Rain World, and also about everything else.

Screams: My time here has been the most eventful time of my life, both the good and the bad.

Screams: It's been a wild ride, and it'll only keep going from here.

Screams: Thanks for playing!
