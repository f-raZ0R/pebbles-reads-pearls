Andrew: Saint is meant to serve as an epilogue to the overarching storyline.

Andrew: A finalization of Rain World's concept of, "As the old world dies, a new ecosystem evolves".

Andrew: This is really the point in the timeline when the era of the iterators meets its end.

Andrew: And with them, the last remaining remnants of the Ancients' civilization ceases its function.

Andrew: I like to think the new state that the ecosystem is now transitioning into is quite similar<LINE>to an older primordial state of the world long before the Ancients even came into being.

Andrew: It's all one big cycle.
