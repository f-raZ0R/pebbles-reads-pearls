Screams: Pups looked really, really weird for most of their development.

Screams: They were just short slugcats with lantern mouse heads. Not even heads with consideration<LINE>put into handling, just code pulled straight from lantern mice and slapped onto the pup graphics.

Screams: They were weirdly tall, too, with some of them being almost as tall as the player.

Screams: Eventually, they got custom heads and faces along with both graphical<LINE>and mechanical code upgrades, turning the weird mousecats into actual slugpups.

Screams: I'd say they look much better for it!
