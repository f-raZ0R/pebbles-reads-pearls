I understand what you are, little beast.

This place is not real, a dream from outside. As if every cycle of my existence has knotted<LINE>together with another's, even if for only a fraction of a second it ripples through mine.

I see my own creation, I see my agonizing decay. I see my hollow structure become a sanctuary in the<LINE>storm, I see a new world unfold without me, as me. I see myself become something else. Yet...

I cannot see the beginning, or end of your own. An aberrant cycle twisting into mine, before spiraling onward into abyss.

What a horrifying destiny you've found.
