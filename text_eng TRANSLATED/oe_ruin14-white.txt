Will: It is interesting which regions got more planning compared to others. OE was always<LINE>on the back burner in some way, while both of Moon's structures were planned and replanned.

Will: Every time I came back to OE it was on a break from doing a larger more intricate region.

Will: It was kind of a good thing, as OE's guiding principle was mostly to keep going west, until all civilization seems to fall away.

Will: I'm happy with how cohesive it became. Progressing from an iterator like wall structure, through a swamp<LINE>of broken machinery. Over a broken bridge, into ancient ruins, a jungle, and finally into the world beyond!

Will: It's a wonder that it all somehow came together and worked!
