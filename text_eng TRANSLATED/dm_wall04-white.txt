Will: This small set of rooms between Luna and Moon's chamber represent a very complex<LINE>issue. Because these rooms are present in multiple parts of the timeline, they must remain<LINE>consistent! However, Rain World's region based structure requires gates to connect regions.

Will: Placing gates without any thought can make players confused, as Five<LINE>Pebbles' structure has already defined several locations where gates are likely<LINE>to be... and inserting a gate in established rooms wouldn't be right either!

Will: So, we became tasked with creating a region structure that made sense between Shoreline and Moon before her collapse.

Will: Our solution in the end was to combine Moon's interior and exterior into one region. Like<LINE>her wall in Shoreline, Moon has many more leaks into the outside world from inside her structure.<LINE>This also reflects in her Wall's design, featuring many open pipes draining from her systems.

Will: Unfortunately, we also had one last problem to solve, creating an imposing and moody entrance to her collapsed structure's underside.

Will: We replaced what would be her CC wall gate,with a connection hallway into her structure, like the kind seen in Five Pebble's Underhang.

Will: I like to hope these compromises made Moon enjoyable to discover on all points of the timeline!
