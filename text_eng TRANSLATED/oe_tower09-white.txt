Will: OE was always planned to be a beautiful sprawling region beyond the machinery of Moon and Five Pebbles' surface areas.

Will: The transition from SB to OE however was something I wanted to place a twist<LINE>on. With the thought of sub feeling like one of the deepest regions in Rain World,<LINE>being flipped on its head with the introduction of the retaining wall.

Will: As well, I wanted players to feel apprehensive about what they might be getting into.

Will: Opening OE with a parasite ridden swamp, worm grass, darkness, and scavengers. Descending deep beneath the surface they knew.

Will: Only to flip them upside down once again when they reach the expanse itself, and find the beautiful sparkling ruins ahead.

Will: The later rooms of the region call back to the swamps from the start, albeit with a much more lighthearted nature!
