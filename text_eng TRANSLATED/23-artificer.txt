This is a warning to the local group, from my senior and neighbor Looks to the Moon, about<LINE>incoming forced communications over the network. She was not aware of my activities,<LINE>and was being starved of water, as I was running a very sensitive process.

The distance between one iterator to another is traditionally much larger than I am to her, and<LINE>because of this we share many resources. The most important of which is our groundwater. I did<LINE>not want her to be involved, but our shared resources prevented that from the start.

There is nothing that can be done now. I cannot forgive her interruption as it destroyed everything<LINE>I have been working towards. However, neither of us are in any shape to be arguing.

We are both doomed if I do not find a way to reverse its effects, but<LINE>the chances of doing so are slowly vanishing. Please let me get back to work.
