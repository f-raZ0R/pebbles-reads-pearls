Andrew: We had an idea for a creature that never got implemented, some gigantic<LINE>spider-like creature whose body you never really get a full view of.

Andrew: It would appear randomly as a rare encounter, in many rooms in the game that had bottomless pits in them.

Andrew: You would just see its spindly legs coming up from out of the pit to try to grab you and pull you down.

Andrew: In an old halloween teaser, we actually shared a spooky image of this thing's legs peeking up from the bottom of the<LINE>screen, but I don't think anyone realized it, or thought those were anything more than some plants or roots or something.
