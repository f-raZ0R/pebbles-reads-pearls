NSH: Moon? Moon, are you able to communicate?

NSH: I am unsure if this broadcast will reach you. I do not know how damaged your systems are.

NSH: Moon, hang in there. We're trying to help you.

NSH: I don't know if we can. But we're going to try.

NSH: We're going to try to see if we can get Five Pebbles to calm down.
