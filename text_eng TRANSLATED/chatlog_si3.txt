SI: There was one particular grand master of cabinet, Seven Clouds Above Endless Canyons, who was quite abrasive in his indoctrination.

SI: To him, his beliefs were absolute and non-negotiable. To suggest otherwise was heresy.

SI: It was enough of an issue that a caste system was inherently formed around it.

SI: Those who strictly upheld the systems of his teachings were treated to the greatest luxuries of literature, art, and architecture.

SI: However, those who did not were damned to the worst living conditions imaginable.

SI: It was a particularly dark time for my colony.

WO: That sounds awful.

SI: What about you, do you have any stories about your inhabitants?

WO: Well, I'd say mine were quite obnoxious. They'd hold festivals and celebrations for arbitrary events practically every other cycle.

SI: Seriously? That sounds like a lot of fun to me. I would have gladly traded spaces with you.

WO: Hah, well, I guess thinking back on it now, there never was a dull moment while they were around.
