[LIVE BROADCAST] - PRIVATE Seven Red Suns, No Significant Harassment

SRS: I'm noticing you are becoming more defensive. This obviously wasn't the end result I was aiming for, you know.

SRS: Please respond to my messages. I don't want to leave it like this. I need someone to talk to.

NSH: I don't mean to be cold, I'm just very worried.

NSH: The activity I'm seeing from Moon's can is becoming increasingly... concerning.

NSH: Our available options are rapidly diminishing, and I feel helpless to do anything.

NSH: I can just watch in horror.

NSH: You should have sent the messenger to Moon instead of Pebbles.

SRS: Do you think that would have helped anything?

NSH: To be honest, no... I'm not sure that it would.
