Will: An older intention we had for this elevator shaft was a way to connect into Five Pebbles' structure.

Will: This path was likely going to connect somewhere above Unfortunate Development, but<LINE>this idea never made it beyond the concept of scavengers fighting corruption under Metropolis.

Will: I guess a big part of that idea was transformed into the labs inside this large<LINE>government temple structure. We left hints that the ancients may have used this place<LINE>as a way to interface with Five Pebbles' systems, without needing to speak to him directly.

Will: Of course, political and important topics were likely brought into his<LINE>actual chamber. Probably for his full attention, and not just some sub-process.

Will: All of this is just fun speculation though! I wonder what ideas the players will have instead?
