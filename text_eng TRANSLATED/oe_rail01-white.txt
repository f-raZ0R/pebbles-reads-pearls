Dakras: Something about seeing one of my first ever tiles from 2017 to one of<LINE>my more recent ones is funny. You'd think it wouldn't even be used still, eh?

Dakras: Most of the custom tiles were done by me, and any of the 3D-looking ones were done by Ongomato.

Dakras: I have to thank him for helping me with some props, such as the 45 Degree antennae you can find in the editor.

Dakras: They weren't used as much as I planned but they do exist. Can you find all of the custom tiles we've made?
