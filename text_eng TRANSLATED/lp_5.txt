[LIVE BROADCAST] - PRIVATE Seven Red Suns, No Significant Harassment

NSH: Tell me more about this messenger. Do they have a name?

SRS: Well, their test number is 07. So I guess that would be their name.

NSH: That name doesn't have much personality though, does it? Don't you think something else might be better?

SRS: You're not wrong on that. More of a placeholder than anything.

SRS: I'll think of some ideas for a name.

NSH: You shouldn't do that until they return to you. Don't get too ahead of yourself.

SRS: ... You're right. Perhaps just 'Messenger' is best... For now.
