What brings you to this lonely place?

Do you seek the same isolation that I once did in flesh?

An angry fool I was, blinded by fervor and pride!

Now here I linger. Chained to the memories of a city I had once struggled to escape!

Bound by recollections of those who I could not leave behind.

The irony is not lost on me, mouse!
