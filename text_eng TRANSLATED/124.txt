Have you noticed, <PLAYERNAME>? The heavy rainfall as of late has begun to recede.

I wonder if Pebbles' machinery finally succumbed to the decay. He was in awful shape last I can remember,<LINE>and even that was a long time ago. Perhaps he finally solved the riddle? For his sake I almost hope so.

Ah, in the end, everything reaches the conclusion of its journey. I'm not sure how many of us are even left in this<LINE>world. A new cycle is already unfolding, one we need not be a part of. We've long outserved our purpose.

However, as long as the microbes in my processing strata continue to function, I'll be here to talk.
