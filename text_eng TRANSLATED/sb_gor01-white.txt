Screams: Food bars for pups became a thing stupidly late in development.

Screams: They were in the works for a while, but I gave up because<LINE>UI isn't really my "thing". I did eventually get them done, though.

Screams: Until they were finished, you checked whether a pup was full by giving it food and seeing if it ate.

Screams: I got way too used to mentally keeping track of my pups' hunger... It made for good brain exercise, I guess.
