Will: It seems a bit backward to think that expanding Filtration System could<LINE>make it easier, but the large reduction in lizard-clogs would help any region.

Will: Due to the original room layout of Filtration System, the lizards would often become stuck in the tunnel toward the Depths.

Will: We chose to insert several new rooms. At first just to solve the lizard clog<LINE>itself, but later these rooms would be expanded by a connection to Pipeyard.

Will: We had to increase the creature density to compensate, but Filter is certainly not any less difficult to explore in the dark.

Will: I wonder how many players will stumble on their Filtration System knowledge, when they trip into one of the new rooms by mistake!
