Will: Writing for Five Pebbles was very difficult! It's hard to write both a smug, and angst-feeling character like him.

Will: A lot of players seem to view him as simply a villain for what happened<LINE>between him and Moon, or even mistake the rot as an intentional creation.

Will: The story itself in the base game is deeper then that, and Moon would never have<LINE>reason to treat him so closely if Five Pebbles was simply a jerk all along. She was a<LINE>big sister to him, and he did have his own relationship with Seven Red Suns.

Will: I think we settled on the idea of a mix of helplessness, from something that is physically impossible<LINE>for slugcat to comprehend. His "god like" identity seems to be posturing, rather then just bragging.

Will: Under that confidence he is still a dying machine. Eaten from the inside out.

Will: His slow transition from anger to helplessness was based off one of Moon's neuron conversations.

Will: Focusing Spearmaster as a sort of betrayal of trust, that SRS understood his goals, but<LINE>then to have the same friend return to them with the worry they might mess up. Only for Moon<LINE>to have caused that situation, and not himself, or at least in his isolated point of view!

Will: We noticed his anger slowly subside by Hunter, even giving Moon his regards as he sends the player off.

Will: Because of that Artificer would serve as a transition period of those two<LINE>states, and would give us the most interaction out of all the other slugcats.
