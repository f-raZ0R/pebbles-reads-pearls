Take this and leave, now.

If you must know... this is a low density mass rarefaction cell.

The energy trapped inside this is incredible, and while my facility is capable of extracting<LINE>it, the shielding on this cell has been damaged. Either through old age, or abuse.

I do not doubt you found this with the scavengers, somehow. While they may not understand the things they find,<LINE>they have a natural inclination for combat. Using these as weapons however, would be horribly foolish.
