It is the remains of an overseer.

20 : 20 : Overseers act as our eyes on the outside.

I used to have a lot of them, but I lost contact with them when I was neutered. My umbilical is cut.<LINE>So, since then I am not much more than what you are looking at - a little creature in a box.

I suspect by now all my overseers are gone out there. Without me they would just roam around with no purpose.

The scavengers tend to hunt them, it's one of their very few ways of expressing defiance.

20 : 30 : It's of course not completely impossible that there are a few left. Say hello if you see one.
