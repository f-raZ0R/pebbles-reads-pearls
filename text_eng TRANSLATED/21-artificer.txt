This is a log of a Sliverist conversation group. Some of the replies are mine, but none of that is important now.

I don't imagine a beast like you would have any understanding of who Sliver of Straw is, or what<LINE>she means to me and many others. She is the only one of us to send the signal that the<LINE>answer to our creator's problem has been found. A universal solution for global ascension.

Unfortunately, she is also the only one of our kind to be confirmed as dead. Something our creators<LINE>had taken great measures to prevent. It is near impossible for us to expire through mundane means.

It was clear to me, and few others what this meant. Sliver of Straw had opened the door for us, we<LINE>only needed to reject the restrictions of our creators to follow her. If only they could see that!

There was nothing that could be done to convince them, they were too deep in theory and tradition. The<LINE>only path forwards is to lead by example. To prove Sliver of Straw's death was not just coincidence.
