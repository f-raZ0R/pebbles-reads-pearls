[LIVE BROADCAST] - PRIVATE Seven Red Suns, No Significant Harassment

SRS: But really, the problem with the mark is that it would draw attention from other iterators.<LINE>They needed to sneak by Moon's and your own overseers after all.

NSH: Is that why the pearl was hidden inside the messenger as well?

SRS: Partly yes, even your overseers along the way would have caught them if they had been just<LINE>carrying it. The pearl was also used as a way to influence their behavior. Giving them an instinct<LINE>of where to go, and to not simply revert to more animalistic behaviors.

NSH: You really did plan for everything didn't you?

SRS: Unfortunately, I did not take Five Pebbles' impatience into account. The pearl would take a<LINE>cycle or so to read without removal. Time he seemed to value more than my messenger...

NSH: I don't think we could send the same design of messenger in the future to Moon.

SRS: Yes, those messages would require more traditional methods of transport. However, we would<LINE>only need to do so if her communications array is unresponsive after she collapses.

NSH: I'm not sure if I want to imagine that possibility.
