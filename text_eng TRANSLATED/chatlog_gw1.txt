[LIVE BROADCAST] - PUBLIC GROUP [OMENSCAGE] Wandering Omen, Pleading Intellect

PI: You haven't heard about what No Significant Harassment did?

WO: All I heard was the complaining. Didn't he send an iterator something distasteful?

PI: Well, yes, but more importantly, he trained a purposed organism to deliver it!

WO: Why do that? Was it so distasteful that he was afraid to send it via the broadcast network?

PI: Just forward thinking. He's been experimenting with alternative communication methods.

PI: So that we all may stay in touch even once our broadcast machinery meets its end of life.

WO: What type of organism was it?

PI: It was based on one of those resourceful, wandering ones that go in pipes. An image should reach you in a few moments...

WO: ...

WO: I see...

WO: How do you even get a dull creature such as that to follow orders? I may consider asking him to teach me his ways.

PI: I wouldn't do that right now. Recent broadcasts from NSH seem like he's been on edge and stressed.

PI: I wonder what happened?
