Screams: I was brought onto the team for pup work because Andrew took interest in<LINE>an old NPC slugcat project I tried to make way back when I was a little baby modder.

Screams: For a while, I kept trying to steer the pup project in the "NPC slugcat"<LINE>direction instead of focusing on the pups themselves, and their quality suffered for it.

Screams: It was only after I rebuilt them from scratch that they really started getting good.

Screams: They actually still have some hidden stat variations as a leftover from that period!
