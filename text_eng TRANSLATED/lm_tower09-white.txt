Andrew: Some of the region acronyms don't match their final region names. Let's take a look at what each of them stood for.

Andrew: (OE) Outer Expanse, (UG) Under Growth, (LC) Lost City

Andrew: (LM) Looks to the Moon, (MS) Moon Superstructure, (DM) Depths of Moon

Andrew: (RM) Rotten Maw, (CL) Collapse
