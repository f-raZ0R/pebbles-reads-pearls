A little beast!

But not as dim as the rest, perhaps?

So down into the depths you go as many others before you, drawn to the void again and again, an endless drip drip drip.

Much like these tunnels and caves that amuse me so. The bones of forgotten civilizations, heaped like so many sticks.

Did they dig too deep, or not deep enough?

Fools. We were right to drill straight through them!
