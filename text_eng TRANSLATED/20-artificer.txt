This is an old conversation between myself and a close friend who I considered a mentor.

We have... Not spoken for a long time now. I can't bring myself to do so. Not after what happened between us.

None of them understood my theories, but Suns, they trusted me. They risked so much trying to help me, and I<LINE>hurt them. It's only now, after I've had so much time to think on it, that I understand why I was so angry.

I lashed out, because out of everyone, they were the last individual I wanted to confront me about my mistakes...

I can't go back now. All I can try to do is recover and try again.

I have to.
