Will: The Precipice once existed only as a short bridge between Moon and Pebbles. It was later<LINE>expanded to connect to Waterfront Complex beneath it due to reworking of Moon's structure.

Will: The intention of this subregion was to create a faster way to reach Five Pebbles in Spearmaster, if the player chose to visit Moon first.

Will: However, when Artificer was moved to the same part of the timeline as Spearmaster (to avoid an Artificer<LINE>Shoreline), having the area between Waterfront and the cable bridge become a CC like gauntlet was irresistible!
