Will: This small collection of rooms act as the heart of Moon's layout, as it borders all four subregions.

Will: Imagine Moon's structure as four areas. The upper region, with her topside, chamber, and memory conflux. Two middle regions,<LINE>one focused around zappers, and the other more on fluxing gravity. Finally, the bottom region containing her leg and underhang.

Will: When players move through these areas, they are unlikely to backtrack to the underhang area, as they are<LINE>likely to feel as if that area will not lead them to progress. This leaves them between the two middle areas.

Will: If they travel up from this room, they will find Moon's outer chamber, with no access to Moon<LINE>herself. However, they are close to the familiar Shoreline rooms, and may attempt to reach Moon that way.

Will: If the player explores the left side of Moon, they will find the Precipice gate before moon tells them. However,<LINE>this gate is much less expensive to leave then enter, and staying inside Moon is more likely the intended path.<LINE>This will lead them to exploring the right hand region, or reaching the crossover tunnel at the top of the left region.

Will: In both cases these will eventually connect them to the familiar sights of a memory conflux subregion! From<LINE>there all the players need is a hint towards her chamber by the use of GSB musical themes similar to Five Pebbles!

Will: Even with all these hints and attempts to guide players without saying anything, getting lost is inevitable, but that's part of the fun!
