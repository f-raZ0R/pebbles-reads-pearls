Another presence attempts to commune with mine.

Have I perceived your voice before? I have existed long enough to overhear them all.

Those who have been, and those who have yet to be.

Each serving as a wave propagating throughout the annals of history.

Listened as I have for many eons, 'tis true, some of those swells cannot help but mirror back.
