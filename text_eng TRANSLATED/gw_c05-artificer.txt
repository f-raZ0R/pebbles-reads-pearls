Andrew: I thought it'd be interesting to make Artificer, the most violent and aggressive<LINE>of the slugcats, also be the character which shows the most motherly love.

Andrew: Everything she does is out of vengance for her children.

Andrew: Artificer's story is a pretty sad one. Forgiveness is not an option for her, but<LINE>no amount of fighting the scavengers will ever be enough, nor really solve anything.

Andrew: There's no real happy ending for her storyline.

Andrew: Either you go the path of embracing the violence, and make a life out of it...

Andrew: Or you can try to take another route, only to find her unfinished business<LINE>keeps her far too bound to this world to ever have any hope of ascending.
