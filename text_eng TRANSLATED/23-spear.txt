It's me writing to the local iterator group... of a conversation I wish I could forget.

"1654.110 - PUBLIC<LINE>Big Sis Moon to Local Group

BSM: Two cycles ago, my neighbor Five Pebbles drastically increased his water consumption to<LINE>four times the normal amount. He has been unresponsive for a period of time longer than that.<LINE>The two of us share groundwater, and I have been without water for almost a cycle.

BSM: Any attempts at communication have been met with complete silence, and my situation is becoming increasingly dangerous.

BSM: I ask the local group for information about when you were last able to contact him,<LINE>and to try to use those same communication channels again, repeatedly until you get a response.<LINE>I will be clear on this - if he is not persuaded to stop whatever it is he's doing, I will die.

BSM: Before that happens, I will utilize my seniority privilege and use forced communications,<LINE>hoping to shake him out of it. Forced communications in the network will be unpleasant for all,<LINE>and I will wait as long as possible before I turn to that option."

In the end, I did use my forced communications, many times. If anything, it only made the situation worse.
