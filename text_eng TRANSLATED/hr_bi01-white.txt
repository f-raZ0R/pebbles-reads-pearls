Andrew: This region went through SO many revisions. And passed hands between at least six different level designers.

Andrew: It also used to just be accessed by a very ordinary region gate. Just one that required 10 karma to pass.

Andrew: The original idea, when Saint was still seen as just an "extreme difficulty" slugcat<LINE>was just to have this be some crazy difficult end-game super hell challenge region.

Andrew: Challenge 80 in challenge mode is some taste of that original design concept.

Andrew: By the way, after the first revision of the region was scrapped, Slugitar<LINE>asked me if the unused rooms could be used for Eastern Expansion instead.

Andrew: So, if you ever saw screenshots of Caldera rooms from Eastern Expansion... those were actually early Rubicon rooms from MSC.
