Cappin: This room was quite the challenge during development.

Cappin: It was one of the first rooms I made for MSC, only five or six screens tall.

Cappin: When I got around to remaking it, I decided to make it absolutely gigantic.

Cappin: It took several weeks to complete! Sixteen screens tall, split<LINE>between climbing up the western side and scaling the spire atop it.

Cappin: Unforunately, the scale caused major preformance issues, so we were forced to cut off the bottom half.

Cappin: It's still in the files, if you'd like to restore it!
