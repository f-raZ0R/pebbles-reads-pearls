Will: The creation of baby centiwings was a bit of a joke at the community's expense.

Will: We saw some posts saying that the aquapede being added was silly, because there was already enough centipede types in game.

Will: However, adding some baby centis as cosmetically different food variants for SI and LC gave me an excuse to be a bit of a butt.

Will: Thankfully, it's only a baby centi with a special spawn flag, and not an actual new creature.

Andrew: Actually, I wanted to add a White centipede too!

Andrew: One whose body gets severed and splits into two smaller centipedes every time you spear it.

Andrew: There's never enough centipedes.
