Will: The fluxing water present in Spearmaster and Artificer's drainage system was done mostly for Artificer<LINE>gameplay. It does however offer an interesting lore perspective of drainage system slowly breaking down over time.

Will: We noticed viewers of the Spearmaster demo stream using this to make<LINE>theories that could place the slugcats' timeline locations based on it!

Will: So, this fluxing was also extended slightly into Hunter, but the effect doesn't offer much gameplay change.
