Andrew: Originally when OE was going to have NPC slugcats and slugpups regularly roaming<LINE>about the region, there was going to be a tie-in with Artificer's void sea ending.

Andrew: There would be a lot of void spawn floating around the deeper parts of the region,<LINE>similar to Shaded Citadel, with void spawn bubbles also situated throughout the area.

Andrew: If you came there with Gourmand after completing Artificer's void sea ending, you could find a crimson colored void spawn bubble.

Andrew: Popping the bubble would release the void spawn, which could then be<LINE>spotted throughout the region later, following the various slugpups around.

Andrew: That all got thrown out when we scaled back our ideas for NPC slugcats, however.

Andrew: Plus I didn't want to introduce the implication that Artificer transformed into a void spawn after their ending, because<LINE>that's kind of weird, and I don't know the lore implications of that, nor how any of that void sea stuff really works...
