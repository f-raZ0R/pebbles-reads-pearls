Andrew: Moon's siren is pretty creepy. I wanted it to sound like the whole superstructure was howling and crying out in pain.

Andrew: Is it normally supposed to sound like that?? Or is that some kind of<LINE>side effect of the superstructure's severe deterioration, and impending death?

Andrew: I also like the detail that it's still functioning in Submerged Superstructure after the<LINE>collapse... though the sound from it severely muffled, since it's buried so deep under the rubble.

Andrew: Some people have asked why Moon has a siren but Pebbles does not.

Andrew: Maybe the siren was used to alert those on the surface of the coming rain. This would have been especially important<LINE>while she was still in the middle of construction and the city on top was not yet fully built and ready for inhabitation.

Andrew: Pebbles is a much newer model of Iterator than Moon, and by the time he was built, the surface was already abandoned.

Andrew: Not to mention with his close proximity to Moon, a siren might be fairly<LINE>redundant, when Moon was already right next door doing the announcing.
