[LIVE BROADCAST] - PRIVATE Seven Red Suns, No Significant Harassment

NSH: So what's your plan now? Did you have a backup mission for the messenger or are you just bringing it back home?

SRS: No, it's over... to tell the truth, I don't even know if the messenger survived.

NSH: How could you not know? Aren't you surveying the situation with your overseers?

SRS: Pebbles destroyed the overseer I sent into his can. Then shortly afterwards I lost communication with the rest of my overseers inside his facility.

SRS: He must have applied a facility-wide lockdown.

NSH: That's quite a desperate measure. I know he's tired of being spied on, but is he allowed to do that?

SRS: There's no rules anymore. Who is going to stop him?

NSH: ...

NSH: You realize this is very bad news, right? That just complicates the issue further.

NSH: Your plan was a complete failure.
