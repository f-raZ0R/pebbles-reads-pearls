Will: Expanding Sky Islands was something that was inevitable.

Will: The default region only has two gates, and only functions as a shortcut between<LINE>Five Pebbles and the end of the game, or from Hunter's start to Five Pebbles.

Will: The location of Sky Island's gate inside Farm Arrays can hardly be considered useful due<LINE>to deer problems, and the fact the gate from Subterranean is for all purposes, one way.

Will: This new route offers an alternative to Chimney Canopy or Subterranean at the start of a Hunter run.

Will: Although, Pipeyard itself functions mostly as a minor hub; a useful path to Shoreline and Industrial Complex.

Will: I hope it finds a place in some unique routes!
