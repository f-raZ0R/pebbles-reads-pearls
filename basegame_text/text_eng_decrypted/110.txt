Oh, this is a deeply concerning discovery. Do you have any idea what this is?

These are known as mass rarefaction cells. They are a type of backup energy source that powered our<LINE>superstructures in times of maintenance, construction, void fluid pipe ruptures, and other general power failures.

In the absence of our creators, to replace deteriorating parts, these cells have become one<LINE>of the major components that allow all of our facilities to remain powered.

However, the fact that this cell is currently in my hands can only mean bad things for whoever<LINE>this originally came from. I sure hope you weren't the one responsible for it becoming misplaced!

I know first-hand the tragedy of losing this power. In the wake of my... accident... all<LINE>of my rarefaction cells were dislodged on impact and washed away in the flood waters.

This cell could be valuable to me, but with my umbilical severed, my overseers running free, and all of my facilities<LINE>lying deep beneath a large body of water, it would be an impossible task to deliver this to a functional location.

You might be able to find an access shaft into my lower structure nearby, but I have no idea how much is left of it.

Please be careful.
