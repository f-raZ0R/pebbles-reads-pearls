NGI: Transcendental Inversion! Transcendental Inversion!!

HR: You can keep saying that as many times as you want, it won't make it any less incorrect.

NGI: It's exactly what you'd want to use for pairwise heterozygous feature matching.

NGI: I've already given you the empirical evidence. It's not my fault you choose to ignore it.

HR: Any Transcendentalist will disagree with your evidence. You're showing a<LINE>fundamental misunderstanding of what such an inversion mode would even achieve.

HR: First of all, unless you have at least two instances of sulfur cast molds which have sufficient entropy<LINE>AND available trailing bonds, then any form of transcendental modification would be pointless.

GS: If you did have entropy that high, trailing bonds wouldn't be sustainable. It's an impossibility.

HR: Exactly! I'm glad there's at least someone in this group that knows what they're talking about.

NGI: I don't know why I even try to explain these things to any of you.
