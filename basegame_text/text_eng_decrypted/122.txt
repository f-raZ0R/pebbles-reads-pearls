It's the fruit of a feathery plant. The body of it is filled with a sweet sticky goo. I suppose that<LINE>once the seeds take root, the sac will rot, and this will help feed the young plant where it landed.

It doesn't look poisonous or hard to open, so it seems the plant's only defense is to float<LINE>away when disturbed. However, I can only make guesses, as I have never seen these before.
