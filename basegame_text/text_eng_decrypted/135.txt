BSM: Do you feel it, old friend?

FP: The sensation of time folding in on itself? The spiraling offshoot of another's reality wrapping around your own?

BSM: None of this is real, is it? Every repeating cycle of our existence unwound and laid bare, a cycle pulled into<LINE>a tangent with itself. Is this what we were looking for? Have we broken free from it, or is this just a dream?

FP: Was the answer always right there? Does the question mean anything to us now that we are here?<LINE>Perhaps a resolution was never possible from our original frame of reference...

BSM: The question wasn't well defined. If we had stumbled upon a correct solution among all of our permutations,<LINE>we wouldn't have had any hope to distinguish it from the faulty ones. Nor did we have a method to reliably test it.

FP: We were trying to understand what lies beyond a point of no return, while having yet to pass it.

BSM: Only those who have seen the other side can know the answers, but by definition<LINE>they can never venture back to deliver the knowledge they have gained.

FP: Perhaps that is why you need to wake up, little visitor.
