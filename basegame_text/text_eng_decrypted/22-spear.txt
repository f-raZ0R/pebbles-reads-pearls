It's an old conversation log from my friends and I. I was quite naive back then! Let me read it to you:

"1650.800 - PRIVATE<LINE>Five Pebbles, Chasing Wind, Big Sis Moon, No Significant Harassment

CW: this is in confidence, but apparently a pseudonym "Erratic Pulse" has appeared on a nearby Sliverist conversation<LINE>with ideas about personal ascension. Someone here in our vicinity is trying to cross themselves out.

FP: Where did you hear this?

NSH: I wish them super good luck in that endeavor. How is it going to happen?<LINE>Have the overseers gnaw through bedrock until their entire can crashes down in the void sea?

BSM: Please be respectful when speaking of the Void Sea. Grey Wind, where did you hear this?

CW: I really shouldn't say. He's going to attempt some sort of breeding program. Thought you might want to know.

NSH: Haha with the slimers, lizards and etceteras? Surely the answer was in a lizard skull all along!

CW: Well, he's not looking for the same thing as we anymore, he's changed his task, so who knows really.

BSM: I will try to find him and talk to him. Please don't spread this around!

NSH: Moon will go get them! Long live the inquisition!"
