Will: OE's early life was plagued by my original style of making rooms. I would try to do too much at once, make every one special.

Will: While I still love the idea of treating every room like its own beautiful little gem, the<LINE>truth is that regions are big, and having something special around every screen is exhausting!

Will: A region needs space for players to breath, rooms that feel like they belong, but aren't putting on a show.

Will: It wasn't until I did Pipeyard, and the Root 2.0 that I fully understood my own balance for rooms.

Will: I went on a big redesign binge after that, trying to fix the things that I felt might be doing more harm then good.

Will: Of course there are limits to what you can change when working on a team! Some liked it that way!

Will: In the end there are regions I am more happy with than others, but I hope players enjoy every one of them!<LINE>Even if they can be a little bit durpy, or be trying too hard sometimes. That gives them some personality I guess.

Will: Don't be afraid to just make rooms in the style of your region. They might make good filler if you find a place for them!
