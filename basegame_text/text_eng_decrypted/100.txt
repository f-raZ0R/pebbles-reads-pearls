Pebbles, I send you this message as your concerned and long time friend.

Unparalleled Innocence had sent an overseer to your can, and we've all observed the<LINE>state that you are in. I know this is my fault, I should have forseen you'd be<LINE>too desperate to escape your situation to do things in proper moderation.

For that I'm very very sorry. However, please, don't disable your communication<LINE>modules. You don't have to go through this alone... everyone has been trying to<LINE>contact you, we only want to help you.

The behavior from your can has become erratic, it's not healthy, and it is not going to solve<LINE>your problems. We have lost all communications from Moon as well, and have reason to believe<LINE>her facility may be suffering irreversible damage from your attempts to fix yourself.

I know better than anyone how you can be about these things, but<LINE>it doesn't have to happen this way... please reply.
