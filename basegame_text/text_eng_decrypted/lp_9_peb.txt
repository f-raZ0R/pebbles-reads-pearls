[LIVE BROADCAST] - PRIVATE Seven Red Suns, No Significant Harassment

SRS: Do you suppose you'll ever raise another messenger?

NSH: If the need arises, I certainly would. After all, I started investigating the method out of the inevitability of our situation.

NSH: We are all slowly dying. By some miracle, our broadcast networks are still functioning, but there will come a time when they too will degrade into a lifeless prop.

NSH: When that time comes, we need alternate methods of communication.

SRS: Well, so far it seems the method at least has some efficacy.

SRS: We can at least say we were able to make a valiant effort to try to save Big Sister Moon.

NSH: I'm tempted to start work on raising another messenger as a last ditch effort, but to be honest I don't think there is any point.

NSH: Not to be a pessimist, but at this rate, there will be nothing left of Moon by the time that messenger would be ready to be sent out.

NSH: There's nothing better for me to do with my time, though.

SRS: Good luck with that. I'll keep you updated as to whether my messenger ever makes a return.
