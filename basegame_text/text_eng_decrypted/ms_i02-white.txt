Will: Moon's collapsed structure is both the largest and most complex region in the game.<LINE>Working off a modified version of her original map, we went into this quite unprepared!

Will: This region went through a few reworks, but the route to and location of her heart has remained the same through all of them.

Will: The arteries act as a fast travel system for Rivulet; any entrance into them will inevitably lead Riv to the heart.

Will: Without many other goals, large chunks of this region are purely cosmetic, and acts as exploration<LINE>filler. However, sometimes not cutting the fat of a region has more benefits then it appears!

Will: As the simple story route goal for Rivulet is hidden inside a region that is made to show the progression of time,<LINE>players will likely have very different feelings, based on if they played Rivulet before Spearmaster, or vice versa!

Will: Familiar places and routes through the structure are intact, but the destruction re-contextualizes them.

Will: The secret little gem of this design direction, is the realization that Spearmaster and Rivulet's unlock are in the same location.
