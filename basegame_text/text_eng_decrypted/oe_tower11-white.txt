Will: OE was one of the first areas I worked on when I was brought onto the team.

Will: Of course, this means it is also the area with the most reworks and changes!

Will: Originally Sunken Pier was only half the size it was, before you reached the expanse itself.

Will: The expanse was also much darker, with a shaded-like underground, and even the idea of a red lizard den hidden in the region!

Will: The restriction of having almost no machinery was pretty hard to follow at first. Andrew eventually<LINE>offered a compromise that some of the underground could have pipes and machines, and any surface<LINE>machinery needs to have been put there much later, or is a fallen piece of the railway above!

Will: I think this region might have one of the best introductions in the mod. Reaching the first screen<LINE>of Outer Expanse after resting in the ancient shelter is something not many players will forget!
