Slugitar: Wow, Rubicon looks incredible! It definitely still has that original feel to it, but with the new colors focusing around<LINE>the void and the whole region being a "trip", it gives it the very much needed make over since the last time I worked on it.

Slugitar: Just seeing some of the rooms I’ve made and also the new as well as the remixed rooms in this new coat of<LINE>paint truly shines a new light on what the original concept was, which was kept perfectly after all this time.

Slugitar: I can remember the chats the team had deciding what would be best for this area as it really didn’t seem<LINE>like it would physically fit between the void sea, so having it a karma Jedi mind trip works extremely well.

Slugitar: All in all the team has made incredible progress not just in the graphics department but also the gameplay department.

Slugitar: This project has truly come a long way.
