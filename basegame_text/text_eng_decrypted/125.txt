Oh. Hello there!

What a strange specimen you are! My memory does not serve me well, but it has been a long time<LINE>since I've encountered one of your species. And none quite with adaptations such as your own. It appears you can breathe underwater. Amazing!

More importantly, I wonder what far away land you have come from, considering the mark you have been<LINE>given? Did you meet No Significant Harassment? Or perhaps Chasing Wind? Or even farther than that?

I don't know why you have traveled all this way, but for what it's worth, the heavy rainfall as of late has begun to recede.

I wonder if that means my neighbor's machinery finally succumbed to the decay. He was in awful shape last I can remember,<LINE>and even that was a long time ago. Perhaps he finally solved the riddle? For his sake I almost hope so.

Ah, in the end, everything reaches the conclusion of its journey. I'm not sure how many of us are even left in this<LINE>world. A new cycle is already unfolding, one we need not be a part of. We've long outserved our purpose.

However, as long as the microbes in my processing strata continue to function, I'll be here to talk.
