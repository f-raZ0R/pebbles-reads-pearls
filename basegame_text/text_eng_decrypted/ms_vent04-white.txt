Dakras: Did you know The Vents (this subregion) is a refrence to Ecco? This<LINE>whole area is in a way if you think about it with all the underwater caves.

Dakras: I just wish I made more underwater decorations from the games before I got burnt out.

Dakras: Some of the plants in that game are beautiful and would translate perfectly to this one, oh well.
