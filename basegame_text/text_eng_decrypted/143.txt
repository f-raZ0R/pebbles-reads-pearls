PEBBLESWAIT : 20

0 : I suppose it was only a matter of time before you ended up here. : 30

Your journey throughout my facility grounds has been incessantly brought<LINE>to my attention by my overseers, thanks to the device that follows you.

It is the citizen ID drone of one of my long departed creators. It seems<LINE>to have been damaged, and imprinted itself with you on reactivation.

Much of the data on the drone has been corrupted. Allow me to do my duty as an Iterator and resync it to my structure.

SPECEVENT : resync

1000 : Little ruffian. You are stuck in a cycle, a repeating pattern. I assume you have come here because you want a way out. : 30

However, there is little I can do. A primal urge, one that tears from deep inside your very core, keeps you bound here.

0 : Even with my divine influence, there is nothing that can be done. : 30

However, if you intend to carry that device around and masquerade as one of my citizens, then perhaps<LINE>you can at least properly perform your responsibility of tending to this superstructure.

From the glimpses I've been shown of your journey so far, it is apparent you have a need to inflict violence<LINE>against the scavenger population. While I find your way of life appalling, it seems we share a common enemy.

A large pack of them has made a home in my city, and have been causing progressive damage to<LINE>the roof of my structure in their attempts to gather scrap metal and other mechanical parts.

0 : As my dutiful citizen, I would encourage you to return home to your city and pay them a visit. : 30

0 : Perhaps in that way, we can both depart from this interaction with something we desire. : 30

0 : ... : 60

0 : I wish you the best in your travels, citizen.: 30

0 : But unless you have something interesting to show or bring to me, it is time for you to leave. : 60
